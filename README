This script installs everything you will need to run
Rosie in the ROS environment with the Fetch. This includes:

* ROS Indigo - Underlying communication system for
  this framework. This must be the Indigo version
  specifically!
* MoveIt! - Motion planning framework that works with
  Fetch and ROS
* ROSbridge - Allows any software to communicate with ROS
  via JSON messages rather than using the Python or C++
  ROS interfaces
* jrosbridge - Java client for ROSbridge used to connect
  Rosie and probcog software to ROS via ROSbridge
* Fetch software - Fetch description, model, and controllers
  provided by Fetch Robotics
* Additional scripts and models for Fetch startup - I wrote
  some extra python scripts and environment files to set Fetch
  up at a table environment
* rosie_msgs package - Contains definitions of all ROS messages
  created specifically for Rosie
* rosie_motion package - Contains the motion server that takes
  Rosie's motion commands and translates them for ROS
* Rosie (if not already installed)
